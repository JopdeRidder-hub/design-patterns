**Bridge Pattern in Python Development**

_What is the Bridge Pattern?_

The Bridge Pattern is a structural design pattern that decouples an abstraction from its implementation, allowing them
to vary independently. It is particularly useful when you need to avoid a permanent binding between an abstraction and
its implementation, enabling more flexibility and scalability in your code.

_Key Concepts:_

* Abstraction: Defines the high-level control interface. It contains a reference to the implementor.
* Implementor: Defines the low-level interface. Concrete implementations of this interface handle the actual work.
* Refinement: Specialized versions of the abstraction that add additional functionality.
* Concrete Implementor: Specific implementations of the implementor interface.
  When to Use the Bridge Pattern

**The Bridge Pattern is beneficial in several scenarios:**

* Avoiding Class Explosion: When you have multiple possible variations of a class, combining them can lead to an
  explosion
  of subclasses. The Bridge Pattern helps manage this complexity by separating the abstraction and implementation.

* Runtime Binding: When implementations need to be switched or extended at runtime, the Bridge Pattern allows for this
  flexibility without modifying the abstraction.

* Platform Independence: When your abstraction should work across different platforms or frameworks, separating the
  implementation helps in isolating platform-specific code.

* Enhancing Maintainability: By decoupling the abstraction and implementation, changes in one do not directly affect the
  other, leading to more maintainable code.
